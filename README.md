# Multi-Agent-Debate-System-using-LLM
Built an AI-driven ML model using Python to simulate intelligent agent interactions within various AI tools. This program leverages supervised and unsupervised learning, model training, and reinforcement learning principles to optimize agent decision-making and adaptability.

A tool-augmented multi-agent system built using LangChain and OpenAI's GPT-4, designed to simulate realistic, evidence-based debates between autonomous AI agents.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack: Python Â· LangChain Â· OpenAI API Â· DuckDuckGo Search API

ðŸ’¡ Features:

Simulates structured debates on complex topics (e.g., remote work, AI ethics)

Real-time information retrieval with source citation via DuckDuckGo API

Custom personas and memory-enabled agents with 10+ turn retention

Supports topic injection and flexible argument strategies

ðŸ“Š Simulated: 50+ dynamic debates with contextual memory and tool-use

Ideal Usage: Showcase of agentic reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and tool integration in LLM systems.
